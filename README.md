# dailyPractice
Add all my daily practice at Git.
03/02/2021 I have created the html folder and the index.html file inside the html folder. 
index.html file is about a email template for a shop in Batearesea.

04/02/2021 I have created the react folder which is included index.html, index.jsx, index.css to display two random numbers and ask to add them and press calculate button to check the answer. I have used React for calculation. But it did not work.  

06/02/2021 I have created javascript folder which is included index.html, index.js, index.css to display two random numbers and ask to add them and press calculate. I have used Javascript for calculation.
